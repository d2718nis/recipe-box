----------
[Build a Recipe Box](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-recipe-box)

### Objective
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/xVXWag)

### Rules
* Use whichever libraries or APIs you need
* You must use both SASS and React to build this project

### User stories
* I can create recipes that have names and ingredients
* I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible
* I can click into any of those recipes to view it
* I can edit these recipes
* I can delete these recipes
* All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will 
still be there

### Hints
* You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. `_username_recipes`
